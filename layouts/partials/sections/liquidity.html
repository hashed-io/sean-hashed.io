      <h2 class="text-primary mb-xl">Generating liquidity from illiquid assets</h2>
      <p>Using Wyomingâ€™s new legislation recognizing digital identities, assets, and organizations, we developed a legal and technological playbook that enables LLCs to directly tokenize its assets on-chain, where they can be trustlessly traded or used as collateral.
      <br>
       <br>We follow this playbook ourselves for tokenizing land, and the on-chain tokens are legally-recognized as final settlement for ownership of the LLC. Contact us to get started tokenizing your assets or crowdfunding the purchase of new ones.</p>
