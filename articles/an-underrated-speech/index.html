His speech took place in Congress Hall in Philadelphia, where Congress ratified the United States Bill of Rights in 1791.</p><p>President Clinton’s speech is especially salient for our times.</p><p>It is inspiring and features a live Presidential demo that erupts to thundering applause. The president provided a compelling glimpse into the possibilities of the technology of the time. The speech is a reminder of our current challenge - the unfortunate absence of national or executive branch leadership on modern Digitalness.</p><p>Link to video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZhqpl0nsOU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZhqpl0nsOU</a></p><p>He starts&mldr;</p><p>Two hundred and thirteen years ago, about 100 feet from where we are now, in a summer as hot as this one, the Founding Fathers drafted the Constitution of the United States.</p><p>In the very first article of that document, they wrote that, government shall make no laws, &ldquo;impairing the obligation of contracts.&rdquo; James Madison called the contract clause &ndash; and I quote again &ndash; &ldquo;a constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights.&rdquo;</p><p>He and his fellow framers understood that the right of individuals to enter into commercial contracts was fundamental not just for economic growth, but for the preservation of liberty itself.</p><p>He later shares his easy to understand, fair principles that served as guidance for the ESA.</p><p>We said that the rules should be simple and nonregulatory, that they should not favor one technology over another, and they should give individuals and organizations maximum freedom to form electronic contracts as they see fit. I&rsquo;m grateful that Congress has kept those principles in mind as it drafted the Electronic Signatures Act.</p><p>Twenty-one years later, the mentions of bipartisanship and common future sound foreign. He mentioned that there was&mldr;</p><p>… a new vision of government and politics that marries our most enduring values to the demands of the new Information Age. In many ways, the Electronic Signatures Act exemplifies that vision. It shows what we in Washington can accomplish when we put progress above partisanship, when we reach across party lines to work for the American people and our common future.</p><p>The demonstration reminds us that this was six years before the launch of the iPhone, and smartphones of course became more ubiquitous than the e-cards. President Clinton finishes with a look ahead.</p><p>And all of you young people will someday look back on this day that you were here and marvel that we thought it was any big deal. And that will be the ultimate test of success.</p><p>Digitalness
Wyoming’s Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology has architected 25 bills on Digitalness that have been enacted into law. This legislation, as Senator Rothfuss may say, is &ldquo;to enable, not to restrict.&rdquo; Digitalness clarity allows not just a new mechanism for digital attestation like the Electronic Signature Act 20 years ago; it also establishes a framework for digital identity, assets, and organizations.</p><p>Digitalness empowers people to govern shared goals and assets at a speed, durability, and adaptability never before seen. This breakthrough innovation will drive economic value throughout the century.</p><p>This Digitalness legislation is broader in scope and scale, yet is cut from the same cloth as the Electronic Signatures Act. There is overlap in the mechanics, and also in spirit, whereas they both &ldquo;marr[y] our most enduring values to the demands of the new [Digitalness] Age&mldr; for the preservation of liberty itself&rdquo;.</p><p>Next article will expand on Digitalness and how it enables DAO LLC and smart contract sovereignty.</p></article></div></div></div><footer class=container><div class=footer><a class=logo href=/hashed.io><img src=/hashed.io/logo/Hashed_Logo_hu4107d61cc47e1d19f58f5ee3b6e44c45_504459_250x90_resize_box_2.png width=250 height=90 alt="Hashed Logo"></a><div class=footer-links><ul class=footer-links-social><li><a href=https://twitter.com/gethyas><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="#fff" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width=".5" stroke-linecap="square" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-twitter"><path d="M23 3a10.9 10.9.0 01-3.14 1.53 4.48 4.48.0 00-7.86 3v1A10.66 10.66.0 013 4s-4 9 5 13a11.64 11.64.0 01-7 2c9 5 20 0 20-11.5a4.5 4.5.0 00-.08-.83A7.72 7.72.0 0023 3z"/></svg><span class=sr-only>Twitter</span></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/teloskitchen><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="#fff" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width=".5" stroke-linecap="square" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-linkedin"><path d="M19 0H5C2.239.0.0 2.239.0 5v14c0 2.761 2.239 5 5 5h14c2.762.0 5-2.239 5-5V5c0-2.761-2.238-5-5-5zM8 19H5V8h3v11zM6.5 6.732c-.966.0-1.75-.79-1.75-1.764s.784-1.764 1.75-1.764 1.75.79 1.75 1.764-.783 1.764-1.75 1.764zM20 19h-3v-5.604c0-3.368-4-3.113-4 0V19h-3V8h3v1.765c1.396-2.586 7-2.777 7 2.476V19z"/></svg><span class=sr-only>LinkedIn</span></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/teloskitchen><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="#fff" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width=".5" stroke-linecap="square" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-linkedin"><path d="M18.384 22.779c.322.228.737.285 1.107.145.37-.141.642-.457.724-.84.869-4.084 2.977-14.421 3.768-18.136.06-.28-.04-.571-.26-.758-.22-.187-.525-.241-.797-.14-4.193 1.552-17.106 6.397-22.384 8.35-.335.124-.553.446-.542.799.012.354.25.661.593.764 2.367.708 5.474 1.693 5.474 1.693s1.452 4.385 2.209 6.615c.095.28.314.5.603.576.288.075.596-.004.811-.207 1.216-1.148 3.096-2.923 3.096-2.923s3.572 2.619 5.598 4.062zm-11.01-8.677 1.679 5.538.373-3.507s6.487-5.851 10.185-9.186c.108-.098.123-.262.033-.377-.089-.115-.253-.142-.376-.064-4.286 2.737-11.894 7.596-11.894 7.596z"/></svg><span class=sr-only>Telegram</span></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/teloskitchen><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="#fff" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width=".5" stroke-linecap="square" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-github"><path d="M9 19c-5 1.5-5-2.5-7-3m14 6v-3.87a3.37 3.37.0 00-.94-2.61c3.14-.35 6.44-1.54 6.44-7A5.44 5.44.0 0020 4.77 5.07 5.07.0 0019.91 1S18.73.65 16 2.48a13.38 13.38.0 00-7 0C6.27.65 5.09 1 5.09 1A5.07 5.07.0 005 4.77 5.44 5.44.0 003.5 8.55c0 5.42 3.3 6.61 6.44 7A3.37 3.37.0 009 18.13V22"/></svg><span class=sr-only>GitHub</span></a></li></ul><ul class=footer-links-information><li><a href=/hashed.io><span>Privacy Policy</span></a></li><li><a href=/hashed.io><span>Cookies</span></a></li><li><a href=/hashed.io><span>&copy;</span><span>Copyright 2021 HASHED</span></a></li></ul></div></div></footer></body></html>
